Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

GrogU is a web application by Thomas Baumann, Huang Shuwei, Claire Conrardy and Kieran Dunch. It was created from scratch over the course of one week in 2022, as part of a pedagogical exercise to simulate an AirBNB-like application using the Ruby on Rails Framework.

The following is a loose outline of each member's specialty during the project, and their personal highlights:

Claire Conrardy: UI/UX Designer, Front-End Developer
- Homepage, all offers page, branding

Huang Shuwei: Full-Stack Developer
- Mapbox and Geocoder integration

Thomas Baumann: Back-End Developer
- Site framework, back-end performance and 'create booking' feature

Kieran Dunch: Product Manager, Full-Stack Developer
- Mapbox customization and branding, bug fixes, project organization, team flexibility and dialogue

Many thanks to the LeWagon Team for providing a strong teaching foundation, and to @Stephlaf, our Batch owner and lead teacher.
